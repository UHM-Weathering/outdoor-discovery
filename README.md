# Overview
In this assignment, we have mocked up the pages of our application which are needed to receive and display data being passed to and from the database. In addition, we added a few classes.  First was the message class, which allows for grouping debug messages before printing, and prevents sending HTTP headers until the page is ready.  Second was the session class, which handles session creation, restart and data.  Finally was the user class, which handles user creation, login, logout, and basic permissions.  We also added a redirection to HTTPS whenever the connection is over HTTP, which increases security of the website.
Our project's GitHub can be found here: https://github.com/UHM-Weathering/outdoor-discovery
